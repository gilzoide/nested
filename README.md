# Nested
A generic nested data structure file format.

Data is formed by nested lists with associated key-value pair metadata.
Each list can have any number of elements, either sublists or text values, and any number of metadata.
Particularly, an empty list with metadata would be like an *associative array*, also called *maps* or *dictionaries*.
